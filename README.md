# P12 Airdrop

Project Twelve is a GameFi ecosystem with sustainable economies. We believe that Game, the 9th Art, is an integral part
of Metaverse, where Gamers and Developers are the two most important components.
STEAM, as a premiere gaming platform, is the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming; players spent almost
38 billion hours on Steam in 2021.

We believe it will be a good means to identify game lovers with the help of Steam data, and we want to give tributes to
all Steam Gamers & Developers!

## For Developers

### Airdrop Tributes

1. Developer specific NFT.
2. $P12 tokens.

### Mechanism

Through Steam API, we get a list of all steam games with their app ID, names, reviews, etc., and we use the signature
method to determine the ownership between developers and games.

Here are the rules and the results:

Steam game developers who:

1. Own at least 1 game on Steam(except DLC).
2. Complete the authentication steps on P12Airdrop website.

will be rewarded with tributes following rules:

1. Each verified game will get 1 Developer specific NFT.
2. The NFT has 4 categories: orange, purple, blue and green.
3. The amount of $P12 that developers can claim is based on their games' reviews and publish date.

### Result Files

We export the results to a public google
folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jKYEUQvfKuJcV84pWSdH96XO05HC4zPs).

Game data is available and complete, while binding relationship between game and address will be continuously updated.
